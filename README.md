## Input
Input is the way the computer gets information from the user

Note: Python initially treats input as a `string` type

Ex.

5 --> "5"
Today is Monday --> "Today is Monday"

### Formula:
`variableName = input("PROMPT")`

PROMT _ A question or statement that the computer ask the user

Python stores the __input__ in the __variableName__
